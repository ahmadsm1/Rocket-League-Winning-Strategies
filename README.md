# Winning Strategies in the Rocket League Championship Series 2021-22

Simply described as soccer but with rocket-powered cars, Rocket League is one of the most competitive video games in the industry with thriving e-sports tournaments. Most notable and prestigious among them is the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) whose participants include  professional e-sports teams from all over the world competing for millions of dollars in prize earnings.

The championship season is divided into 4 splits:
- Fall major
- Winter major
- Spring major
- Worlds.

Teams accumulate points based on their rankings in these events, which allow them to qualify for the world championship.

Teams come from the following regions:
- [NA] North America
- [EU] Europe
- [SAM] South America
- [OCE] Oceania
- [MENA] Middle East & North Africa
- [APAC] Asia Pacific North/South
- [SSA] Sub-Saharan Africa

NA and EU have traditionally had the best performing teams but promising teams have begun to emerge from MENA and SAM.

Some questions we have about this topic include:

- What play styles (ground, aerial) have higher chances to win a game?
- Do players from specific regions play more aggressively or passively than those from other regions?
- Does playing faster than the opposing team prove to be a more successful strategy?

## About the dataset

This dataset focuses on the most recent iteration of RLCS, the 2021-2022 season. It includes statistics such as the number of goals per team in a match, the number of saves, amount of boost used, assists made, total number of shots, total distance traveled and much more. It includes the data from every match, from every team and from every split.

This dataset has been constructed by saving the games from every match during the tournament, extracting the data from the save files and organizing it into a presentable format. The corporations and groups included in this procedure include Psyonix (the game studio behind Rocket League and organizer of RLCS) and octane.gg, the website hosting all of this data.

Our purpose for working behind this is educational and out of personal curiosity but we hope to gain insight into what strategies the winning teams employ, and then extrapolate our findings to predict which teams will win in future tournaments.
